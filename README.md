# Hi, welcome to my GitHub! 

<p>I'm a junior Ethical Hacker focused on Pentesting and Malware and threat analysisat <strong>. 

I've been in technology since 2018 as an Information technology student with a background computer networking, and up until this  time I fell in love with Cybersecurity security and its associated tools so I  decided to break into this field with desire to delve deeper into with the most diverse types of technologies  like: gamming programming, web programming, network management systems, system architecture). 

What has enchanted me the most is recent cases of cyber breaches on both small and large companies that have cost them their clients and capital. I see computers and its systems as being capable of being vulnerable at all times but by using the right security technologies, we can have an almost perfectly secured system
